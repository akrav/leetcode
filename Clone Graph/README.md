# Clone Graph
Difficulty: Medium

## Question
Clone Graph
Solved 
Given a node in a connected undirected graph, return a deep copy of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains an integer value and a list of its neighbors.

class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
The graph is shown in the test cases as an adjacency list. An adjacency list is a mapping of nodes to lists, used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

For simplicity, nodes values are numbered from 1 to n, where n is the total number of nodes in the graph. The index of each node within the adjacency list is the same as the node's value (1-indexed).

The input node will always be the first node in the graph and have 1 as the value.

Example 1:



Input: adjList = [[2],[1,3],[2]]

Output: [[2],[1,3],[2]]
Explanation: There are 3 nodes in the graph.
Node 1: val = 1 and neighbors = [2].
Node 2: val = 2 and neighbors = [1, 3].
Node 3: val = 3 and neighbors = [2].

Example 2:



Input: adjList = [[]]

Output: [[]]
Explanation: The graph has one node with no neighbors.

Example 3:

Input: adjList = []

Output: []
Explanation: The graph is empty.

Constraints:

0 <= The number of nodes in the graph <= 100.
1 <= Node.val <= 100
There are no duplicate edges and no self-loops in the graph.

            if node not in self.dic.keys():
                clone_node = Node(node.val)
                self.dic[node] = clone_node
            
            for neighbor in node.neighbors:
                if neighbor in self.dic.keys():
                    self.dic[node].neighbors.append(self.dic[neighbor])
                else:
                    self.dic[node].neighbors.append(dfs_create(neighbor))
            
            return self.dic[node]

        dfs_create(node)
        return self.dic[node]
```
